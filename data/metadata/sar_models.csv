MP01GS01,"The sulphate aerosol (direct effect) and greenhouse gas experiment (GSD): The forcing includes not only the greenhouse gas forcing described with the ""greenhouse run"" but also the direct radiative effect of historic sulphate aerosol concentrations from 1860 to 1990 and a scenario of sulphate aerosol concentrations from 1990 to 2049. The sulphate aerosol concentrations are calculated in the ECHAM4 model from the sulphur emissions in the IS92a scenario.","The ECHAM climate model has been developed from the ECMWF atmospheric model (therefore the first part of its name: EC) and a comprehensive parameterisation package developed at Hamburg therefore the abbreviation HAM) which allows the model to be used for climate simulations. The model is a spectral transform model with 19 atmospheric layers and the results used here derive from experiments performed with spatial resolution T42 (which approximates to about 2.8º longitude/latitude resolution). The model has also been used at resolutions in the range T21 to T106. ECHAM4 is the current generation in the line of ECHAM models (Roeckner, et al., 1992). A summary of developments regarding model physics in ECHAM4 and a description of the simulated climate obtained with the uncoupled ECHAM4 model is given in Roeckner et al. (1996).

The time-step of the model is 24 minutes, except for radiation which uses two hours. The ocean model is an updated version of the isopycnal model (OPYC3) developed by Josef Oberhuber (Oberhuber, 1993) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany. The name OPYC is derived from Ocean and isoPYCnal co-ordinates. The concept to use isopycnals as the vertical co-ordinate system for an OGCM is based on the observation that the interior ocean behaves as a rather conservative fluid. Even over long distances the origin of water masses can be traced back by considering the distribution of active or passive tracers. Treating the ocean as a conservative fluid fails in areas of significant turbulence activity such as the surface boundary layer. A surface mixed-layer is therefore coupled to the interior ocean in order to represent near-surface vertical mixing and to improve the response time-scales to atmospheric forcing which is controlled by the mixed-layer thickness. Since the model is designed for studies on large scales, a sea ice model with rheology is included and serves the purpose of de-coupling the ocean from extreme high-latitude winter conditions and promotes a realistic treatment of the salinity forcing due to melting or freezing sea ice. The experiments from which results are used here are the 1000-year unforced control simulation using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 model and then two climate change simulations. The greenhouse gas only forced experiment (referred to as GGa1) used historical greenhouse gas forcing from 1860 to 1990 followed by a 1 per cent annum increase in radiative forcing from 1990 to 2099. The greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forced experiment (referred to as GSa1) used the GGa1 forcing, plus the negative forcing due to sulphate aerosols. This was represented by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading. The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. For 1860 to 1990 the historic sulphate aerosol forcing estimate was used and for 1990 to 2049 the aerosol forcing estimated for the IS92a emissions scenario. The GSa1 experiment did not extend beyond 2049. Several papers describe results using this version of the model - see Bacher et al. (1998), Oberhuber et al. (1998), Zhang et al. (1998)."
MP01GG01,"Here the greenhouse gas forcing is increased gradually to represent the observed changes in forcing due to all the greenhouse gases from 1860 to 1990. From 1990 to 2100 it uses an increase in concentrations represented by the IS92a emissions scenario with the Copenhagen modifications of industrial gases. This is sometimes referred as ""IS95a"". In GHG, the concentrations of the following greenhouse gases are prescribed as a function of time: CO2, CH4, N2O and several industrial gases. From 1860 to 1990, the annual concentrations of these gases are prescribed as observed and, from 1990 onward, according to the IPCC'92 scenario IS92a. For the industrial gases, the IS92a scenario has been updated to be consistent with a Copenhagen-like emission scenario (IPCC'96). All of the time dependent, or 'transient', forcing experiments have been initialised at year 100 of CTL, nominally 1860 in the transient experiments. However, these initial values do not correspond to 'pre-industrial' (1860) but to present-day conditions. This applies not only to SST and other climate variables but also to the concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O. In the transient experiments, this initial shift in concentration is taken into account by enhancing the observed/projected concentrations of these gases in an appropriate way (Appendix A).","The ECHAM climate model has been developed from the ECMWF atmospheric model (therefore the first part of its name: EC) and a comprehensive parameterisation package developed at Hamburg therefore the abbreviation HAM) which allows the model to be used for climate simulations.

CS01GG01,"Here the greenhouse gas forcing is increased gradually to represent the observed changes in forcing due to all the greenhouse gases from 1881 to 1990. From 1990 to 2100 it uses an increase in concentrations represented by the IS92a emissions scenario. The model radiation code includes only CO2, water vapor and ozone. The other radiatively active trace gases are included as equivalent CO2. We used the IS92a emission scenarios. This gives approximately a 0.9%/year increase in equivalent CO2 after 1990. In practice the whole CO2 series was scaled so that the 1880 value matched the model control value (330 ppmv).","The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the ""cold start problem"". This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 ºC/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an ""equivalent"" CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot."
CS01GS01,"The forcing includes not only the greenhouse gas forcing described with the ""greenhouse run"" but also the direct radiative effect of sulphate aerosol concentrations. The direct aerosol effect was included as a surface albedo perturbation. The sulfate mass fields were obtained from the UKMO and are as used by Mitchell and Johns (1997). However optical properties different to those of UKMO are used. The optical properties are based on Kiehl and Briegleb (1993) rather than Charlson et al (1991). This gives a smaller forcing which probably is a more realistic estimate of the direct forcing alone. The 1990 direct forcing is about -0.4 W/m^2 in the CSIRO coupled model compared to -0.65 in the UKMO model.","The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations.

GF01GG01,"The value of CO2 increases gradually from the initial value (approximately equal to the value observed in 1958). The rate of 1% per year increase in CO2 is approximately equal to the rate of total radiative forcing of all greenhouse gases (CO2 +O3 + freons + ..) of the IPCC ""business as usual"" scenario. The initial conditions in the model atmosphere and ocean are in no way related to the conditions in 1958. Therefore due to natural variability both in the model and in the observed climate the state is different even though the radiative forcing was about equal between model and nature.","The experiments with the GFDL model used here were performed using the coupled ocean-atmosphere model described in Manabe et al. (1991) and Stouffer et al., (1994) and references therein. The model has interactive clouds and seasonally varying solar insolation. The atmospheric component has nine finite difference (sigma) levels in the vertical. This version of the model was run at a rhomboidal resolution of 15 waves (R15) yielding an equivalent resolution of about 4.5º latitude by 7.5º longitude. The model has global geography consistent with its computational resolution and seasonal (but not diurnal) variation of insolation. The ocean model is based on that of Byan and Lewis (1979) with a spacing between gridpoints of 4.5º latitude and 3.7º longitude . It has 12 unevenly spaced levels in the vertical dimension. To reduce model drift, the fluxes of heat and water are adjusted by amounts which vary seasonally and geographically, but do not change from one year to another. The model also includes a dynamic sea-ice model (Bryan, 1969) which allows the system additional degrees of freedom. The 1000-year unforced simulation used here is described in Manabe and Stouffer (1996). The drift in global-mean temperature during this unforced simulation is very small at about -0.023ºC per century. The two GFDL-R15 climate change experiments used here use the IS92a scenario of estimated past and future greenhouse gas (GGa1) and combined greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol (GSa1) forcing for the period 1765-2065 (Haywood et al., 1997). For the GGa1 experiment only the 100-year segment from 1958-2057 are available through the IPCC DDC. The radiative effects of all greenhouse gases is represented in terms of an equivalent CO2 concentration, and the direct radiative sulphate aerosol forcing is parameterised in terms of specified spatially dependent surface albedo changes (following Mitchell et al., 1995).

(1996) for results from a set of sensitivity experiments including the 1% per year CO2 increase experiment compared to experiments that include direct and indirect effects of sulphate aerosols. Two climate change experiments were performed, both starting in the year 1900. The first uses greenhouse gas radiative forcing (represented by equivalent CO2) observed during the 20th century, and extends greenhouse gas forcing to the year 2035 by increasing CO2 1% per year compound after 1990 (CO2-only experiment). The second includes the same greenhouse gas (equivalent CO2) forcing as the first, but adds the effects of time-varying geographic distributions of monthly sulphate aerosol radiative forcing (CO2+sulphates experiment). These are compared to a 135-year control experiment with no change in external forcing. Climate system responses in the CO2-only and CO2+sulphates experiments are marked not only by greater warming at high latitudes in the winter hemisphere, but also by a global ""El Nino-like"" pattern in surface temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure. This is characterized by relatively greater increase of SST in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific compared to the west, a shift of precipitation maxima from the western Pacific to the central Pacific, mostly decreases of Asian-Australian monsoon strength, lower pressure over the eastern tropical Pacific, deeper midlatitude troughs in the north and south Pacific, and higher pressure over Australasia. An EOF analysis of surface temperature indicates that the ""El Nino-like"" pattern in the model characterizes not only CO2-only and CO2+sulphates climate system response to time-varying external forcing, but also internally-generated climate variability at the El Nino and decadal (9-20 year) timescales. These results indicate that the ""El Nino-like"" pattern is a ubiquitous response in the climate system that occurs at different timescales due to different forcings. The coupled model climate change experiments show that time-evolving external forcing can introduce this same low frequency response pattern into the coupled climate system."

NC01GS01,N/A,"The NCAR model version used here is the NCAR-DoE global coupled model (sometimes referred to as the Washington-Meehl coupled model. Submissions to the DDC using the later NCAR CSM and PCM models will follow). Simulations of 20th century climate and projections of climate into the 21st century were conducted with a global coupled climate model without flux adjustment (these experiments are described in Meehl et al.

HC01GS04,Here the greenhouse gas forcing is increased gradually to represent the observed changes in forcing due to all the greenhouse gases from 1860 to 1990. From 1990 to 2100 it uses a 1 per cent per year compounded increase in concentrations (a rather larger forcing scenario than is represented by the IS92a emissions scenario). The forcing due to sulphate aerosol includes the direct radiative effect of historic sulphate aerosol concentrations from 1860 to 1990 and a scenario of sulphate aerosol concentrations from 1990 to 2100 derived from the sulphur emissions in the IS92a scenario. Sulphate Aerosol and Greenhouse Gas Integration (GSG): The IPCC Data Distribution Centre (DDC) distributes data of 4 ensemble runs. This experiment represents member #4 of the ensemble.,"The experiments performed at the Hadley Centre used the Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represented a large step forward in the way that climate change was modelled by GCMs and raised new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment overcame some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5° x 3.75° (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5°C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 (Mitchell et al., 1995; Johns et al., 1995). The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04°C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995; and Airey et al.,1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The following gives a list of the climate change integrations that have been performed using HadCM2.

The climatology constructed from the 240-year CTL run serves as a reference for the time-dependent forcing experiments.","The experiments performed at the Hadley Centre used the Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represented a large step forward in the way that climate change was modelled by GCMs and raised new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment overcame some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5° x 3.75° (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5°C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 (Mitchell et al., 1995; Johns et al., 1995). The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04°C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995; and Airey et al.,1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The following gives a list of the climate change integrations that have been performed using HadCM2. HadCM2GGa1-4: an ensemble of Greenhouse Gas Integrations (historic equivalent GG 1860 - 1989, 1% compound increase GG 1990 - 2099) and HadCM2GSa1-4: an ensemble of Greenhouse Gas plus Sulphate Aerosol Integrations (GGa forcing plus historic SO4 1860 - 1989, IS92a SO4 1990 - 2099)."
HC01GS01,Here the greenhouse gas forcing is increased gradually to represent the observed changes in forcing due to all the greenhouse gases from 1860 to 1990. From 1990 to 2100 it uses a 1 per cent per year compounded increase in concentrations (a rather larger forcing scenario than is represented by the IS92a emissions scenario). The forcing due to sulphate aerosol includes the direct radiative effect of historic sulphate aerosol concentrations from 1860 to 1990 and a scenario of sulphate aerosol concentrations from 1990 to 2100 derived from the sulphur emissions in the IS92a scenario.

NI01GG01,N/A,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6º latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8º horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1% / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius."
